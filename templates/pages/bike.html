  <p><strong>Bike service</strong></p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Bike servicing is somewhat analogous to general health checkup of a man, which is in fact more important than the latter but not less as a living being has self cleaning and repairing mechanism which a bike lacks. It should be done regularly as suggested by the dealer/manufacturer to keep your bike in the best condition. Some people avoid servicing till the bike shows some type of problem, which is the reason behind the problem itself most of the time.</p>

<p>Sometimes people don&rsquo;t keep in mind about their bike service but DrivoZone gives you a reminder of your bike&rsquo;s service and even give a home service at your home.</p>
